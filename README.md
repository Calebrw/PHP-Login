# PHP-Login

Simple, secure and MySQL-free login system.

## How it works

* The system is coded in PHP, HTML and CSS.
* The visual framework used is [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).
* Three main pages are used: `login.php` to show the login form, `index.php` as the default password-protected area and `logout.php` to end the session.

## How to use it

1. Download the source files to your computer.
2. Open `login.php` with your favorite text editor (I suggest you use [Atom](https://atom.io)) and find the array `$logins`.
3. Change the usernames and passwords for your own.
4. Save the files, upload them to your webserver and give it a try.
